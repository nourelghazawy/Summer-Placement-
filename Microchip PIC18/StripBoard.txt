Encoder Microcontroller to the Arm
The PIC is communicating to the arm using UART1 on the ARM, I used the receive line (PB6) and didn't need the transmit line.
I used two pins to distinguish between the two encoder, PIN RA0 on the PIC to be connected to PB_12 on the ARM.
PIN RB3 on the PIC to be connected to PB_2 on the Arm.
The Left encoder is connected to Interrupt 0 which will need PCFGA4 bit in ADCON1 Register to be set otherwise the interrupt won't work. This is because the same pin is used for the ADC as well.
If you want to supply the PIC from an external supply pin 11 (PGM) should be connected to ground. (This is done in the PCB)
